            <p>After spending few months in lockdown during corona,
                the plan for Darjeeling was finally ready. We board the train on the early
                morning of 1st January 2021 from Malda Town(MLDT) and reached New
                Jalpaiguri(NJP). You may book a hotel room through the agents near
                the station and depart for Darjeeling.<br><br>

                    <strong>Darjeeling</strong></a> is a destination that defines
                serenity in its beautiful language. Once a mountain kingdom,
                Darjeeling exhibits a religious harmony between Hinduism and
                Buddhism, has its floors covered with Hindu shrines and Buddhist
                monasteries. The varied culture of the town reflects its diverse
                demographic milieu comprising Lepcha, Khampa, Gorkha, Kirati , Newar,
                Sherpa, Bhutia, Bengali and other mainland Indian ethnolinguistic groups.

            <h2>Weather At Darjeeling During Winter</h2>
            <p>Usually, the average temperature remains between 2 to 15-degree
                centigrade during January. It was mainly because of the <strong>weather
                    in Darjeeling in January</strong> and to enjoy nature after a long period
                trapped in lockdown that made us quite bore, the reason we planned
                on paying a visit to Darjeeling. The weather was too pleasant and
                made our overall experience extremely wonderful. Although the
                temperature didn't touch sub-zero, the weather was breezy, a little
                chilly, and comfortable enough for us to experience Darjeeling to the
                fullest.

            <h2>Hotel In Darjeeling</h2>
            <p>Upon reaching our destination, situated 2100 m above sea level, we
                searched for a hotel. I request viewers to look for a hotel
                nearby upon reaching instead of booking online. There will be many
                hotel options available to you at a lesser price. <br>
                We stayed in <strong>Sonar Bangla</strong> hotel from which Mount
                Kanchanjanga was visible. It was a fascinating view. The hospitable
                staff of these hotels welcomed us with arms wide open and the best
                of services. Hotel Sonar Bangla was our favorite accommodation.
                As we were about to try local <strong>Tibetian and Nepalese cuisine</strong>
                we haven't taken the food options. Any restaurant that has the food
                served there was in itself drool-worthy. The hotel management
                helped us by pre-booking the car for sightseeing for all 4 days. </p>

            <h2>What To Pack For Darjeeling In January</h2>
            <p>Darjeeling is all set to welcome the chilly winds in the month of January.
                There are certain things that one must-pack for their excursion as you
                donâ€™t want any regrets once there. When talking about a packing tip for
                Darjeeling trip, we recommend packing as many woolens as you can.
                Be sure enough to have all your winter essentials like gloves, socks,
                boots, jackets, and pullovers.</p>
